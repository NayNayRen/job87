## About Job 87

Job 87 is a rebuild of an ePortfolio/Blog and eLearning website of Jason C. I met him like 10 or 12 years again through playing Clash of Clans on my phone funny enough. He's a good guy, some of the hats that I know he wears are :

- a husband
- father
- teacher
- and basketball coach

All content used is of Jason's ownership and used with his permission. None of the social media or email join list is connected. This is just a project built for myself to be used as a project site.
