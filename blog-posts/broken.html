        <h1>Fix it, even if it's not broken</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          When I first began teaching I was open to any and every idea that
          would help me to sustain my career. I was often afraid that I would
          get fired for ineptitude. Well, I was close a few times in those early
          years. As the first year turned into the second, and second turned
          into the fifth, I soon realized that I was pretty comfortable with my
          routine. My preps stopped changing and I then knew all the answers.
          The system that I had worked very well. The test scores were always
          very high, the students appeared to be happy, and parents didn't
          really complain (to my face at least). I was too comfortable.
        </p>

          I eventually moved to a different school and tried teaching the same
          way. That was a mental car crash on a daily basis. The students were
          not interested, the resources were lacking, the administration was
          apathetic, and the parents were not very involved, at all. I found
          myself starting all over. I was worried about my ineptitude once again
          because I was not very successful. I was stuck in a fixed mindset.

          >, it appears that I was good at teaching the "what", and sometimes
          the "how", but I was definitely not good with the "why". I only lasted
          a year before I moved to a new school. I found that same comfort zone
          in teaching that I had before. I was much better with the "how" at
          this point. I started to grow as a teacher, but then I plateaued as
          soon as I had an opportunity. I didn't know any better. Again, the
          scores were great, the students appeared interested and laughed at my
          "dad jokes" throughout the year, and the parents were very happy.

          My real changes actually began when the students AND my colleagues
          challenged me. When the students don't care at all about my subject, I
          find myself stepping out of the fixed mindset and moving toward the
          growth mindset. Once I moved to my current school district, I was
          surrounded by colleagues that were insanely intelligent and worked
          relentlessly to find creative ways to educate our students. I had to
          grow just to keep up.

          One of my goals was to win the teacher of the year award. It took 7
          years to do so in a school with almost 3000 students, but it happened.
          My new goal is to change the administration's format relating to
          technology integration in the classroom. My plan is to have a blended
          campus in the next 3 years. That will take a lot of growth from the
          students, teachers, and administration. I don't think it will be as
          difficult a process as it appears. I think that my school needs to
          adopt the mantra "If it isn't broke, STILL FIX IT."
