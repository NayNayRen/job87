    <h1>Passionate Learning</h1><br>
    <p>I've stated that learning is often forced and difficult. It hurts to see students that are disengaged and filled with apathy
      towards any subject. What has changed since the early elementary years where the majority of the students seemed so happy
      to be at school? I've heard that teachers kill creativity and imagination in students. Well, I've witnessed it. I've been a part of
      the problem myself.
    </p><br>
    <p>I believe that teaching students shouldn't be something that we force, but instead something that we inspire. Learning is
      filled with many instances of failure that is encouraged with opportunities for success by trying again.
    </p><br>
    <p>I've come to the realization that the video game model of game play illustrates how learning should take place. The learning
      sessions should be quick, filled with mini-obstacles that can stump a person if they aren't prepared. The student would learn to
      overcome the obstacle after a few "games". They would then feel that sense of accomplishment as they move on to the next
      level. They would be inspired to move forward.
    </p><br>
    <p>This learning environment would allow students to progress at their own pace while being able to find pleasure in learning. If
      there was a classroom structure where students had a character that was supposed to shoot/capture/tackle (or any other action
      verb that works) nouns, dodge verbs, and jump over adjectives, students would be more engaged.
    </p><br>
    <p>If there was a high score posted every day or every week, students would take more pride in their achievements. They would
      also be learning without the painstaking red marks on their papers, or the teacher shaking their head while telling the student
      they were incorrect.
    </p><br>
    <p>Students also need to get up and explore, create, and invent on their own at times. Teachers can't always give students all
      of the information that they need in order to be successful.
    </p><br>
    <p>If students were guided instead of lectured, learning would have a different feel to it. The passion for learning would start to
      come back if students had much more freedom and creativity.
    </p><br>
    <p>In an age where the state tests mean more to the school than it does to the student, teachers are often handcuffed when it
      comes to creativity. It will take courage when taking the bold steps forward to present new ideas to our administration, but I
      think that it is worth it. This antiquated system is tried and true, but not necessarily as great as it can be.
