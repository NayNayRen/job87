        <h1>Growth Mindset Plan</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          Changing a mentality is something that is one of the most challenging
          tasks I’ve ever had to accomplish. Years ago, I was working at a
          school that had not witnessed very much success as a whole. My job was
          to change the culture, the mentality, of the people that I
          encountered. Being young and inexperienced, I told the students that
          they would work as hard as they could and stand up to ANY person that
          doubts their progress. The problem was, I didn’t use those same words.
          The words that I chose were much more aggressive. What I wanted was
          for the students to believe in themselves and grow. It worked. It was
          the wrong way to get the message across, but it worked. Fast forward
          almost 15 years and you’ll find that same teacher learning how to
          teach the same message the right way. What I didn’t understand then
          was the “Growth Mindset”.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Growth Mindset is one that teaches concepts of continual growth in
          a particular field compared to a fixed mindset where one has accepted
          the current situation as one that will be permanent. I believe that
          everyone will have a fixed mindset at some point. How long we have
          that mindset will be different for each person. We should strive to be
          better than we were in the past, but actually implementing change is
          rather difficult if we don’t welcome change.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          My plan is to embrace the growth concept as I teach my students high
          school English 1. My campus has not experienced the necessary success
          in this subject the district deems valuable, yet. The demographics on
          my campus include a large population of students that are relatively
          new to the English language, yet are still expected to pass the state
          exams. As teachers, we are still expected to produce the same results
          as other campuses. Although it is ludicrous, I’ve found that I need to
          implement the growth mindset in order to help get my students and
          campus to reach expectations. The process won’t be easy, but using the
          “COVA” concept, I feel that I will be able to instill the necessary
          methods in order to help the students reach the districts goals.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          COVA is a concept that states giving Choice, Ownership, Voice, and
          Authentic lessons will help the students take more responsibility in
          their education. My plan is to create daily, weekly, and semester
          lessons that institute the COVA model. Eventually I will present this
          idea to my colleagues and have them eventually incorporate the same
          ideas into their classrooms. I am anticipating backlash from both
          groups, but that is the point in which I will institute the power of
          “yet”.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The growth mindset has a vital component that we know as “yet”. This
          idea means that if it hasn’t happened already, don’t give up on it, it
          will happen soon. Many people believe that if they haven’t reached a
          particular goal, they will never reach it. That mindset is one that is
          fixed. There is a lack of growth in that frame of mind. My students
          and colleagues need to be exposed to the idea that growth happens over
          time and it is not immediate. We all need to have the understanding
          that we should continue to pursue our goals even if it didn’t happen
          in the timeframe that we wished.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When I begin to incorporate the COVA strategy, along with the power of
          “yet”, I will be able to help my students grow in areas that were once
          deemed unimaginable. It may not happen immediately, but I am patient
          enough to understand that growth does not happen overnight.
