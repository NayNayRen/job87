        <br />
        <p>
          If you were to ask me what I imagined my 17th year in education would
          look like, I can guarantee you I would not have expected this. We
          finished our last "regular" school day on a Thursday in March, right
          before Spring Break. We never expected Covid-19 to devastate our world
          the way it has. Call me crazy, but for the all of us in the education
          world, it was the "gift wrapped inside of the curse".

            My innovation proposal</a
          >
          for our school scripts how to take advantage of the opportunity that
          Covid-19 has given us by using the technology we were given in order
          to implement the blended model format. The teachers can lead best by
          giving the students the platform to take control of their education
          and eventually fall in love with being a life-long learner.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The education of today's youth is a process that is an
          instructor-lead, arduous task that we love to do. The planning, the
          decorating, the late nights, the grading, the early morning coffee,
          the amazing lessons, the detailed rubrics, and perfect lecture, and
          the minimal response from students. WHOA! We think "They should LOVE
          this topic! I've dedicated so many hours to making it great!" Not so
          much.<i class="fa fa-meh-o"></i>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The work ethic from the teachers is not wrong. The process should be a
          little bit, well, a lot less stressful. We need to put the learning in
          the students' hands. We need to have the students become more engaged
          and gain the passion to be life-long learners. We can do this by
          simply implementing the Blended Learning model.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Blended learning is a model that implements online learning as well as
          in class instruction. There are multiple formats that can be
          implemented so it gives the educators the opportunity to be as
          flexible as they choose. The students will be more engaged because
          they will have more choice in their learning path. Whether they are
          using the Rotation models, the Flex, A La Carte, or Virtual Enriched
          platforms, students understand that they have more freedom and less
          stress in their education.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The purpose is not designed to take away jobs from teachers. That is
          not an option. These learning models enhance the need of teachers.
          Teachers can actually help the students with their more specific
          needs.

          that documents other programs worldwide that use blended learning so a
          skeptic can gain insight on success rates for students and school
          districts. The information listed is designed to present factual
          information that will inform anyone that is unaware of how the program
          functions.

            My implementation outline</a
          >
          will explain the time frame expected for the program to be in full
          swing. I plan on implementing this model by building virtual classes
          online and then piloting them during the school year. The students
          will be engaged at a higher rate because they will be in control of
          their time of study, pace, place, and path they choose to learn. When
          they have questions on ideas or topics, they can always reach out to
          me for assistance. The students will quickly realize that their stress
          level for these classes will be significantly decreased.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In the initial stages of implementation, there will be a lot of
          questions and answers. There will be many days where I will work on
          making the pilot classes perfect, but I will probably fail in some
          capacity. That is okay. I will receive the feedback from the students
          and staff, fix the inaccuracies, and then deliver a stronger product.
          This process will repeat until the school year of 2021 is ready to
          begin. We will build more classes in various subjects that will
          benefit the students in their next step in life, whatever that may be.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Learning should not feel like punishment. It should be progressive,
          engaging, and student driven. The technology we have received has made
          it possible for all of our students to reach heights that have never
          been reached before. So instead of being angry that we are learning
          how to incorporate technology into our lessons, be optimistic. Let's
          take advantage of this amazing opportunity and begin preparing our
          students for the future that is already here. The time is now.
