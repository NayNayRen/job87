          Ownership is tricky. What do we really own? Do I own my car or my
          house if I still have payments remaining. If someone can tell me what
          to do with the things that I think I own or even lawfully take them
          away, do I really own them?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I've been learning about ePortfolios and what constitutes ownership.
          Ownership of an ePortfolio is not really about money or payments, it
          is about the control over what goes into it, how it is assessed and
          why.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Teachers would have students create these electronic portfolios and
          then tell them exactly what to put inside of it. Not only that, there
          also would be strict guidelines on how it should look and how it would
          be graded. This isn't ownership, it is copying the teacher's model
          while adding a little bit of individuality. That definitely isn't true
          ownership and it definitely isn't true learning.

          Gardener Campbell, a Director of the Academy for Teaching and
          Learning, stated that
          <a
            href="https://er.educause.edu/articles/2009/9/a-personal-cyberinfrastructure"
            target="_blank"
            >"students must be effective architects, narrators, curators, and
            inhabitants of their own digital lives". He stated that "students
            with this digital fluency will be well-prepared for creative and
            responsible leadership"</a
          >. <i>(Campbell, 2009)</i>. Students need to be in control of their
          learning in order to create meaningful, worthwhile connections.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Obtaining ownership of an ePortfolio also means letting students have
          flexibility in how they are assessed. If a teacher gives a rubric to a
          student that details exactly how a project or assignment is supposed
          to look, does that student really have any intellectual freedom?
          Probably not. There are times when a student can feel that their ideas
          have to fit inside of a small box due to a rubric because it tells
          them exactly what to think.
        </p>

          In a 2015 post by Andrew Rikard it was stated that
          <a
            href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-08-10-do-i-own-my-domain-if-you-grade-it"
            target="_blank"
          >
            “We don’t really own our ideas if our ideas are controlled by a
            grading entity.”</a
          ><i>(Rikard, 2015)</i>. Students must be guided in the right
          direction, but not completely controlled. We have learned that the
          COVA model
          <i>(choice, ownership, voice, and authentic assignments)</i> and CSLE
          <i>(creating significant learning environments)</i> can give us
          control over the design of entire learning environments."
          <i>(Harapnuik et al., 2018, pp. 43)</i>.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In Dr. Harapnuik's article "It's About the Learning: Who Owns the
          Eportfolio", it was stated that we should
          <a href="http://www.harapnuik.org/?page_id=6050" target="_blank">
            "effectively model what we expect our students to do with their
            ePortfolio by showing them ours, then the feedback we can provide to
            our students will be much more valuable and more openly
            received."</a
          >
          <i>(Harapnuik, 2019)</i>. It is okay to guide them by letting them see
          examples of prior students work as well as the teacher's work. This
          idea will still lead to authentic student output because they have
          recognized the direction in which they should be headed. This is
          ownership.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When students feel the freedom to express themselves in the capacity
          in which they feel comfortable, then they will be moving towards
          ownership. It is the teacher's job to give them the opportunity to
          have intellectual freedom in their education.
