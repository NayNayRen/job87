      <h1>Meaningful Connections - Getting Started</h1><br>
      <p>I started to create my ePortfolio on this wix website during EDLD 5305 when I had no clue what it included nor why. Knowing
        why you do something is always more important than just doing the action. There is purpose behind the portfolio now. I assumed
        it was just an easy way to collect all of my data.
      </p><br>
      <p>Once there is ownership in your work with a dedicated goal in mind, the portfolio becomes an extension of who you are.
        While I will have to heavily edit what I started, I am fine with the idea because it will give me an opportunity to show true
        ownership. I look forward to growing in this process throughout the duration of the class.
      </p><br>
      <p><strong><i>(Edit)</i></strong> Well, looking back at what an ePortfolio is, I understand now what it takes to make a decent one. The definition
        on Dr. Harapnuik's post called <a href="http://www.harapnuik.org/?p=5934" target="_blank">Minimalist Definition of an Eportfolio</a>
        states that an ePortfolio is simply "a learners digital evidence of meaningful connections." I've noticed that I've struggled knowing
        what meaningful was until I finished making sense of the purpose of the Eportfolio. Documenting this journey is a process that
        should be done on a consistent basis in order to have honest output. There are days when there is frustration. There are days
        when there is pride in my successes. I've found that I tend to only want to write about the later. If I am documenting meaningful
        connections, I need to do a better job of documenting my struggles also. They tend to stick with me much longer, unfortunately
        being a little bit more meaningful.
