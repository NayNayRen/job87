      <h1>Growth Mindset - Revisited</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Initially, I learned a great deal of information relating to the
        growth mindset vs a fixed mindset.
        <a href="../blog-posts/passionate.html" target="_blank">
          My previous post</a>
        documented some differences between a fixed mindset and a growth
        mindset. What I've learned is that it is EXTREMELY difficult to have a
        complete growth mindset. It is tiresome and seems unrealistic to have
        that mindset all the time. It appears to be glorious and well worth
        it, but it is tough.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Previously, I learned that people with a fixed mindset may believe
        that people are either born with talent or they are not. Individuals
        with a growth mindset believe that they can accomplish anything
        through hard work and dedication. It sounds great, but a growth
        mindset is all about the constant push to be better. It is retraining
        your brain to stop listening to the people in our lives that hold us
        to a minimum standard, and to stop listening to ourselves when we are
        filled with doubt. This is the new standard when it comes to
        understanding what it will take to have any real form of disruptive
        innovation.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        My plan is to change the way my entire school functions two days out
        of the week. I plan to have our students take extra classes in an
        asynchronous, blended format, because they enjoy it. The problem is:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ol>
        <li>Students don't enjoy school.</li>
        <li>
          Administrators don't enjoy major change (where I am currently
          teaching).
        </li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <p>
        Everyone will tell me "No!" and will quickly explain that it can't
        work or it won't work. I've learned that growth is gradual and it
        needs to be implemented over time. I do not believe that a structural
        and conceptual change will be welcomed by students, faculty, or
        administration. The initial plan was to simply create the lessons
        based on the COVA model and focus on the power of "yet". That isn't
        good enough. My plan is to create the class while focusing on how well
        the students will learn.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I've researched models of learning and have come to find that Mark
        Robber has taught about how the youth tends to learn. The learning is
        not focused on your first chance or second chance trying to solve a
        problem, but instead on having fun learning many things while failing
        multiple times. This is a video game based approach to learning. Video
        games keep people's attention for hours on end while they are
        constantly learning, failing, learning, failing, and learning more.
        There is no real anger, frustration, or lack of empathy when they are
        learning when playing video games, but instead a desire to figure it
        out. That is what I want my class(es) to emulate.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I still whole hearted believe that the fixed mindset should be changed
        using the four major steps. I just believe that helping the students
        to have fun learning by creating a class based around these steps will
        be easier than purely teaching these steps.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I am well aware that this will not be an easy task. I am well aware
        that educators and administrators with Doctorate degrees, Masters
        degrees, and more formal and informal education than I will ever
        receive, will eventually scoff or laugh at my innovation plan. I am
        prepared to make my English pilot class one that will mesmerize
        audiences of young and old.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We must change from a behaviorist teaching philosophy and move closer
        towards the constructionist teaching philosophy as soon as possible.
        We must put the power in the students' hands and let them begin to
        enjoy learning compared to enduring learning. I firmly believe that I
        can start this program and change the way our school functions
        forever. Well, change it until it needs to be changed again. That is
        the power of growth.
